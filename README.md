Hey everyone, I'm Rod Fitzgerald.

I develop a variety of stuff depending on the contract. Full on merc style.
My personal goal is to develop AI for a mech (thinking like armoured core or as I've recently learned about, Mech Warrior.)

I'm interested in learning more unique math equations and developing my own that focus on efficenticy and ideally with keeping the computional factor down.

For collaborations I'm open to freeware video game based development.

If there's an internal system to contact me on github then that's the way you'd reach me for now.
